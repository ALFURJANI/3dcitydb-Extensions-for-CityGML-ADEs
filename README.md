# 3DCityDB-Extensions-for-CityGML-ADEs
This repository is intended for providing some extended relational database schemas in SQL which can be directly run and used as extensions to the latest version (3.3.0) of the [3D City Database](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb) for efficiently storing and managing CityGML with Application Domain Extensions (ADE) using Oracle or PostgreSQL database system. Every of these relational database schemas has been full-automatically derived from the XML schema definition file (XSD) of the respective CityGML ADE by performing a model transformation process which is based on a number of fine-gained mapping rules that allows for mapping object-oriented models to entity-relationship models with respect to database complexity and semantic interoperability. As a result, the derived database schema can intuitively represent the semantic structure of the original object-oriented models using a simplified and optimized database structure without information loss and hence garantees the interoperable data access and efficient processing time when, for example, queying the thematic and spatial data stored in the database tables.
